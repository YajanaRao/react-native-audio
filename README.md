## Install

Install the module using yarn or npm
### Using npm

## Getting started

First of all, you need to set up the player. This usually takes less than a second:

```javascript
import TrackPlayer from 'react-track-player';

await TrackPlayer.setup({})
// The player is ready to be used
```

## Player Information
### Event handler

```javascript
import { addEventListener } from "react-track-player";

subscription = addListener("media", function (event) {
  // handle event
  console.log("from event listener", event);
  if (event == "skip_to_next") {
    skipToNext();
  } else if (event == "skip_to_previous") {
    skipToPrevious();
  } else if (event == "completed") {
    skipToNext();
  } else {
    updateStatus();
  }
});

subscription.remove();
```

### API

```js
TrackPlayer.getState()
```

This method can be used to get the state of the player

**Returns**: Promise<String>

#### Get Position

```js
TrackPlayer.getPosition();
```

Get track player progress position.

**Returns**: Promise<number>
#### Get Duration

```js
TrackPlayer.getDuration();
```

### Hooks

#### useProgress

useProgress accepts an interval to set the rate (in miliseconds) to poll the track playerâ€™s progress. The default value is 1000 or every second.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { TrackPlayer, useProgress } from 'react-track-player';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { position, duration } = useProgress()

  return (
    <View>
    <Slider
          style={{ width: '100%', height: 40 }}
          minimumValue={0}
          maximumValue={duration}
          value={position}
          onSlidingComplete={value => {
            TrackPlayer.pause();
            TrackPlayer.seekTo(value)
            TrackPlayer.play();
          }}
        />
      <Text>Track progress: {position} seconds out of {duration} total</Text>
